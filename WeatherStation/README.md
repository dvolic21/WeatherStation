### To build the project, follow these steps:
#### Clone the repository to your local machine:
   1. Using clone with SSH:
       ```
            git clone git@gitlab.com:rit-croatia/swen-383-800-g1/weatherstation800g1.git
       ```
      OR

   2. Clone with HTTPS:
        ```
           git clone https://gitlab.com/rit-croatia/swen-383-800-g1/weatherstation800g1.git
        ```
#### Navigate to the project directory and open it in the IDE of your preference
   ```
      cd weatherstation800g1
   ```
   
#### Build Java Project in IDEs VSCode, IntelliJ IDEA or NetBeans
1. Run the WeatherStationRunner.java file.
   - To build a Java project in Visual Studio Code (VSCode):
     - Open the Command Palette (press Ctrl + Shift + P) and select Java: Run to compile and run your code
   - To build a Java project in IntelliJ IDEA:
      - Right-click on the WeatherStationRunner.java file and select "Run"
   - To build a Java project in NetBeans:
     - To run your code, right-click on the WeatherStationRunner.java file and select "Run File"
2. Three options will appear where you can choose to run a class:
   - 1:   WeatherStation
   - 2:   SwingUI
   - 3:   AWTUI
3. Enter the number of the class you want to run.
   - If you choose option 1 (WeatherStation), the text output from the WeatherStation class will be displayed.
